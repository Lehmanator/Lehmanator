## Skills, Technologies, & whatnot

### ✨ Things I know

I've messed around and gotten my feet wet with _dozens_ of technologies, frameworks, languages, tools, etc.
For the sake of brevity, I will only list the ones I am willing to call myself proficient with.

- CI / CD: GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages, Nix, Hercules-CI
- Environment configuration: Ansible, Nix, NixOS, asdf, devcontainers
- Cloud Environments: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS

#### Languages

- Functional Programming: Nix

- Web Development: Javascript, Typescript

#### Platforms

- Linux FHS / POSIX API
- GNOME / freedesktop technologies

#### Misc Stuff

My last professional role was as a system administrator,
so I have lots of experience configuring, deploying, & managing
user workstations, developer environments, enterprise networks, & production servers
running both Microsoft Windows & Linux.

Technologies:

- Routing: DNS resolvers, DNS records & nameservers, Multicast DNS, DHCP, VLANs, Wireguard tunnels, Tailscale mesh networks

- Remote management: SSH, RDP, VNC
- Cryptographic protocols: TLS, SSH, GPG, age, PKCS#11, Certificate Authorities, LUKS, TOTP

- [ ] TODO: Split "Cryptographic protocols" into symmetric/asymmetric cryptography, communication/data encryption, some other categorization?
- [ ] TODO: Split "Routing"
- [ ] TODO: Split "Authentication" into "Authentication/Authorization"?
- [ ] TODO: Browser-related security stuff like CORS, HSTS
- [ ] TODO: DNS verity stuff like DNSSEC, DMARC, DKIM, SPF

### 🌱 Currently Learning

- Yew
- GTK Development
- Flatpak & XDG Portals

### Things I want to learn in the future

- ActivityPub
- Expand my Tensorflow skillset
- Linux kernel development
- Zsh plugin development
- Nushell

### Homepage

- Website: [samlehman.dev](https://samlehman.dev) **Note: Currently under major reconstruction**

### Forewarning

**Note: Many of these accounts will probably change in the near future as I migrate to self-hosted infrastructure on my own domains.**

I am currently bootstrapping a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster using [NixOS](https://nixos.org) & [kubenix](https://github.com/hall/kubenix).

Once my cluster is battle-ready, I will spin up servers for:

- Mastodon
- Matrix
- Git forge (probably Forgejo, maybe GitLab)
- Probably a lot more I'm forgetting about

then migrate my accounts there.
If you hit a dead link, remind me to update them by opening an issue here.

## To-Do

- [ ] Test links
- [ ] See above

### Additions

- [ ] Add personal projects list
- [ ] Add contributor projects list
- [ ] Add public keys?
- [ ] Add resume link
- [ ] Add some personal info not about tech
- [ ] Add inline images for certain technologies?
- [ ] Add links for certain technologies?
- [ ] Add emojis to make usage parallel. (or remove them altogether)
- [ ] Add links to request access to email / phone number?
